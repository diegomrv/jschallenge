# Flickr API photo search
Technical exercise about making API requests using just Javascript, displaying them on a page and change the UI without refreshing the page.

## How to use
At load, Flickr photo search will randomly show one of the 3 default searches for 'Mexico City', 'Vancouver' or 'San Francisco', but you can search for whatever you want using the header input.

You can load more search results by clicking on the "Load more" button and view a photo's large size by clicking on the thumbnail.

Navigate the gallery with the keyboard arrows or using the Previous and Next links in the lightbox, and close it using the Escape key or by clicking on the Lightbox backdrop.

That's it!
